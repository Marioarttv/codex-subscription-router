# Compatibility

The patcher is intentionally tied to known ChatGPT desktop bundle structures.
It verifies every modified renderer, main-process, and native binary anchor and
stops instead of applying a partial patch.

## Current validated source

A different official version may work when all anchors remain identical, but
it is unverified. The patcher rejects a version, build, or ASAR hash mismatch by
default; `--allow-untested-source` is an explicit diagnostic override. Never
weaken an anchor-count or binary-constant check merely to make a new build
complete. Review the upstream change and update the patch deliberately.
